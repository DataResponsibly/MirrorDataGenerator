# MirrorDataGenerator
MirrorDataGenerator is a python tool that generates synthetic data based on user-specified causal relations among features in the data. It focuses on how features relate with demographic attributes (e.g. gender, race, disability status, etc), which are considered as sensitive information for certain domains (e.g. employment, housing, etc).
